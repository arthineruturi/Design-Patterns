## Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that builds upon the Factory pattern. It involves creating interfaces for product families, ensuring that all products in a group follow the same blueprint or behavior.

### Example:
Imagine we have different car manufacturers like Toyota and Hyundai.
In the context of a vehicle factory, we can use the Factory pattern to create instances of cars or bikes without exposing the creation logic to the client.
 We can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create factories for each manufacturer (ToyotaFactory, HyundaiFactory), and these factories can then create instances of cars or bikes specific to that manufacturer.
