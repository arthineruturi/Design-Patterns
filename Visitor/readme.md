# Visitor Design Pattern Example

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

### Overview:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
- **Visitor Interface**: `ReportVisitor` interface defines methods for visiting different types of elements.
- **Elements**: Elements like `Course`, `Student`, and `Assessment` implement the `Element` interface and accept visitors.


### Advantage:

- **Flexible Design**: Easily add new operations without modifying existing classes.
